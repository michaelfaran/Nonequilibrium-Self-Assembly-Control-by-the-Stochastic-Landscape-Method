# Nonequilibrium Self-Assembly Control by the Stochastic Landscape Method

This repository contains the post-processed data and MATLAB scripts used to reproduce all figures presented in the manuscript and Supplementary Information (SI) of:

**Title**: *Nonequilibrium Self-Assembly Control by the Stochastic Landscape Method*  
**Authors**: Michael Faran and Prof. Gili Bisker

---

## Purpose
This repository supports the reproducibility of results and visualizations from the study. It includes:
- **Post-processed data**: Results from stochastic landscape simulations, organized by figures.
- **MATLAB scripts**: `.m` files to process data and recreate the manuscript's figures.

This repository extends the work on the **Stochastic Landscape Method (SLM)**, which has been previously applied and implemented in the following studies:
1. [**Non-equilibrium Self-Assembly Time Forecasting by the Stochastic Landscape Method**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jpcb.3c01376): Repository available at [SA_UI](https://github.com/OkTAU16/SA_UI).
2. [**A Stochastic Landscape Approach for Protein Folding State Classification**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jctc.4c00464): Repository available at [Protein Folding Classification](https://github.com/michaelfaran/A-Stochastic-Landscape-Approach-for-Protein-Folding-State-Classification).

## Repository Structure
- **Main Folder**:
  - MATLAB scripts (`.m` files) for generating figures.
  - Each script corresponds to a specific figure, e.g., `Fig2.m` generates **Figure 2** in the main text, while `Fig2_SI.m` generates **Figure 2** in the SI.

- **Data Subfolders**:
  - Each figure script has an associated `data` subfolder containing all necessary processed data files.

---

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB.
3. Run the desired script from the main folder to generate its corresponding figure.
   - Example: Running `Fig2.m` will reproduce **Figure 2** in the main text.
4. Ensure the `data` subfolders are correctly placed alongside their corresponding scripts.

---

## Requirements
- **MATLAB**: Version R2020b or later is recommended.
- All required data files are provided in the `data` subfolders.
